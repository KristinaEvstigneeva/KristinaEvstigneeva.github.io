            <p><b>About the cultural event:</b></p>
            <p>The exhibition of works by Titian will be one of the highlights of 2013. The great master of the Renaissance, Titian Vecellio (1488/1490 – 1576), has entered the history of world painting as an outstanding colorist, the founder of the genre of psychological portraiture, a reformer of religious and historical painting, and a precursor to the Baroque era. The exhibition will feature works of various genres – portraits, paintings on religious and mythological subjects: "Flora" from the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, "Danae" from the Capodimonte Museum in Naples, "Madonna with Child" from the collection of the Accademia Carrara in Bergamo, "Portrait of Count Antonio di Porcia" from the Brera Art Gallery in Milan, and others. In total, the exhibition presents 11 works from 10 museum collections in eight cities of Italy.</p>
            <p>The works presented at the exhibition reflect Titian's entire creative path, offering the viewer a comprehensive gallery of the master's images and compositions. The influence of Giorgione is clearly traced in the early works of the artist. Then we see how the artist gradually develops his own style and expressive manner.</p>
            <p>The exhibition is a vivid illustration of the cultural richness of the Italian regions and will be a splendid prelude to the Italy-Russia Cross-Year of Tourism. Its events cover the period from September 2013 to September 2014 and will be dedicated to the sights of small, less known to the general public, cities of Italy within the framework of the promotion program under the "Made in Italy" brand and the development of cultural tourism.</p>
            <p>The curator of the exhibition is Professor Giovanni Villa.</p>
